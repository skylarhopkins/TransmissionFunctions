#'Minimize the negative log likelihood to find the best-fitting density-dependent transmission function
#'
#''DD.optim' uses optim() to minimize the nll and fit the density-dependent transmission function
#'given random starting parameters centered around the true/known values for Beta and gamma.
#'
#'You can use this function on it's own, but it is meant to go inside the optimization loop for all models
#'
#'@param FoI The true force of infection, which is used with nref to find a truebeta as a mean for picking random starting values
#'@param N The size of the mid-sized or reference population (Nref), which is used to scale the FOI to a truebeta for the DD function
#'@param gamma The true value of gamma, which is used as a mean for picking random starting values
#'@param datasets Dataframe with dataset for each population as a column
#'@param initial.inf vector of initial number of infected individuals in each population
#'@param initial.sus vector of initial number of infected individuals in each population, which should be pops - initial.S
#'@param samp.sizes vector of sample sizes, in number of individuals, that were sampled to estimate prevalence at each time point
#'@param pops vector of total population sizes in each population, which should be initial.S + initial.I
#'@param time.outs a single value indicating how many time units (e.g., 21 days days) the ODE should be simulated for - should be as long as largest time.samp
#'@param time.samps vector of the times when the populations were sampled, such as 0, 7, 14, and 21 days
