\title{Simulate an SIR model using ordinary differential equations a constant host population size}
\usage{
sir(t, y, parms)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{numeric vector. The time at which the instantaneous rates are evalated.}

\item{y}{named numeric vector. Initial population sizes of Susceptible and Infected individuals, labeled with S and I}

\item{parms}{named numeric vector. List the parameter values being used for beta, gamma, K, and N, the total population size.}
}
\value{
Returns the instantaneous rates of change in the number of susceptible and infected
individuals, dSdt and dIdt, respectively
}
\description{
'sir' returns the instantaneous rates of change in the number of susceptible and infected
individuals, dSdt and dIdt, respectively
}
\details{
'sir' is used with the ode function to simulate an epidemic through time assuming constant area and
given known starting population sizes of susceptible and infected individuals, beta: a transmission rate,
gamma: a recovery rate, and K: a unitless density dependence parameter that allows the
transmission function to take on any form. When K=0, the transmission function is frequency-
dependent. When K=1, the transmission function is density-dependent. And when 0<K<1, the
transmission function is an increasing, saturating function of host density.
